# Example of an ISDN PRI interface on port 0 that has directed channels.

# 10 channels (channel 11-15,17-21) are outgoing only.
# 10 channels (channel 22-31) are both way.

# Example of an ISDN interface that runs in NT-mode, but provides tones during
# setup. Also we provide tones during setup also.
# This is usefull to interconnect to another PBX.

# They are: setup, dialing, proceeding, alerting, disconnect

# Example of an interface on port 0 connected to another LCR
# This can be done by direct cross cable (terminated of course) or via L1oIP.
# Since the remote side (NT-mode) normally doesn't accept informations like
# redirected number or display facility, use 'te-special' to even transmit that
# against the ISDN specifications. A remote LCR can handle that.
# Now all information elements can be transmitted in both directions.

# Example of an ISDN interface on port 1, with alternate tones_dir to use.
